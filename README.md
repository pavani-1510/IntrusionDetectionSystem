# 📄 Project Guide: Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning

### 1️⃣ What is an IDS? Why is it important?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that monitors a computer network for suspicious or malicious activity. Anomaly-based IDS detects attacks by identifying unusual patterns in network traffic, even if the attack is unknown.

### 2️⃣ What does this project do?

This project builds an anomaly-based IDS that:

* Collects network traffic data
* Extracts features from the data
* Trains an ML model on normal traffic
* Flags unusual traffic as suspicious
* Displays results on a dashboard

## 📄 Concepts & Background: IDS & Anomaly Detection

### 1️⃣ Basics of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity protects computers & networks from attacks that can steal or damage data.

### 2️⃣ What is Network Traffic?

All communication over a network (packets, flows) between devices.

### 3️⃣ What are Cyberattacks & Intrusions?

Unauthorized activities like hacking, data theft, malware installation, DoS.

### 4️⃣ What is an IDS?

An IDS is a system that detects intrusions by monitoring and analyzing network or host activity.

### 5️⃣ Types of IDS

✅ Signature-based: Detects known attack patterns
✅ Anomaly-based: Learns normal behavior, flags deviations

### 6️⃣ Why use ML for IDS?

ML can detect novel attacks that don’t match known signatures.

### 7️⃣ How does ML-based Anomaly Detection work?

Train ML on “normal” data → test on new data → flag high deviations as anomalies.

### 8️⃣ Key ML Algorithms

✅ Isolation Forest: Detects outliers by isolating points
✅ Autoencoder: Neural network learns to reconstruct normal data, high error → anomaly
✅ One-Class SVM: Separates normal from abnormal in feature space

### 9️⃣ Features of Network Traffic

Examples:

* Duration of connection
* Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
* Number of bytes sent/received
* Flags set (SYN, ACK, etc.)
* Number of failed login attempts

### 🔟 Common Datasets

✅ NSL-KDD: Benchmark dataset, cleaned version of KDD’99
✅ CICIDS2017: Large, realistic with modern attack scenarios
